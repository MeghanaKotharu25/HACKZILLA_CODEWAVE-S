## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Model Loading Architecture
```python
# AIS Model (HuggingFace Primary)
AIS_MODEL_REPO = "MeghanaK25/ais-isolation-forest"
AIS_MODEL_FILENAME = "isolationforest_model.pkl"

# SAR Model (HuggingFace Primary) 
SAR_MODEL_REPO = "MeghanaK25/sar-oil-slick-detection"
SAR_MODEL_FILENAME = "training_history.pkl"  # As specified

# Local Fallbacks (As requested)
LOCAL_AIS_MODEL = "/Users/lakshmikotaru/Documents/ais_isolation_forest/isolationforest_model.pkl"
LOCAL_SAR_MODEL = "/Users/lakshmikotaru/Documents/sar_oil_slick_detection/hf_deployment/training_history_subset.pkl"
```

### Pipeline Flow
1. **AIS Input** → Vessel data (MMSI, speed, course, etc.)
2. **Anomaly Detection** → Isolation Forest analysis
3. **SAR Input** → Upload image or use Red Sea demo
4. **Oil Detection** → ResNet-based analysis with confidence scoring
5. **Integration** → Combined risk assessment and alert generation
